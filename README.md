This is a set of (hopefully) useful [rash](https://github.com/willghatch/racket-rash) configuration files.  You can use whatever you want out of them but they will probably change and nothing is gauranteed to work perfect.  I'd also recomend checking out the [rash demo files](https://github.com/willghatch/racket-rash/tree/master/rash/demo).

The main goal of these files is provide the user with a set of useful functions/macros/aliases like `alias` and `export` that help minimize keystrokes.  Another goal is to have it work out of the box and not be environment specific, so tell me if something doesn't work for you.  As rash becomes more stable, I hope to turn this into a sort of oh-my-zsh for rash.

As of now there is no windows support because I can't get racket's readline library to work on windows.  I don't plan on supporting windows in the near future either because it doesn't have very much respect for command line interfaces.  If you really want to use it on windows, I would recommend using the windows subsystem for linux.
