These are my [rash](https://github.com/willghatch/racket-rash) configuration files, you can use whatever you want out of them but they will probably change and nothing is gauranteed to work perfect.  I'd also recomend checking out the [rash demo files](https://github.com/willghatch/racket-rash/tree/master/rash/demo).

One goal is to provide the user with a set of useful functions/macros like `alias` and `export` that help minimize keystrokes.

Another goal is to have it work out of the box and not be environment specific, so tell me if something doesn't work for you.  As of now there is no windows support because I can't get readline to work on windows.  If you really want to use it on windows, I would recommend using the windows subsystem for linux.
